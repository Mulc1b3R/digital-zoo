Build your own digital lifeforms - Self organinsing digital 'entities' , a taste of things to come...

## Demo

View the live demo here @ https://psicodata.io/digitalzoo/index.html   and build you own amazing self organizing digital entities , the 'units' form into 'clusters' displaying

remarkable self organization , caused by the universal laws of attraction and repulsion... Displaying attributes that can only be described as 'Emergant Phenomenon'.

Adjust settings with pinpoint accuracy , Track clusters , dislpay inter-relationships by drawing lines between atoms in a similay was to particles.js , make video's

of your 'pet' forms and export at the click of a button... Alter the number of colours on screen and the number of atoms per colour , watch some clusters form into digital versions of

simple cellular organisms while others display 'preditory' behaivior. Witness formations display remarkable similarities with cosmological phenomena.

No two experiments are the same ,unless you load pre-set templates ,due to the intricate complexity of the environs...And the possible permutations.

Although the Zoo is a novel place to spend some downtime ,it raises some serious questions regarding the origins of life it's self in relation the the emergence of complexity

from simplicity ...

 ## Mods
 * Added 6 extra lifeforms ( 'lime','purple', 'magenta', 'violet','gold','silver').
 * Reduced number of possible 'atoms' per unit in correspondence. ( there is a lot of data to capture in real time in your browser ).
 * Added 'Favicon' , Capured data as .webm , breakdown into 600+ seperate (.png) frames totalling 75mb , recompiled to a single .gif , 880 kb .
 * Created 'container' for desktop web-app , teleport 2 the zoo via hyperdimensional space ,thanks to Tim Lee, ( a keen eye will notice that it is not the same icon as the favicon ).

##Desktop app

If you want a desktop web-app version just click on the 'digital zoo.url' (all 246 bytes of it) , in the list of files above.
This will open the file window here on github , click the download symbol , upper right , this will activate the down load. when it comes down go to 'downloads' on your machine ,
the os may append '.download' to the file making it ' midas.url.download' delete the appended '.download ' turning it back to 'digital zoo.url'(if u r using windows just ignore
any warning,microsoft does this with anything they didn't create)) and drag to desktop . The image is burned in to the url regardless of where you put it or whatever you rename it...
just double click on the ICON and the zoological garden will appear in a millisecond or two... (The app is so small it will register as '0 storage' on your machine...) 
Don't be suprised if you have never encountered this method before , that's because i only created it recently...
